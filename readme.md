edge-db
=======

This is a Sql compiler for edge.js derived from [edge-sql](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge-sql "edge-sql"). It allows accessing databases from Node.js using [Edge.js](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge "Edge.js") through ADO.NET 
At the moment three kinds of databases are supported: mySql, Oracle and Sql-Server

Added support for: sessions, transactions, multi tables results.
Added support for DateTime, guids, any array of char/bytes.


This is meant to be used through [edge-sql](https://github.com/gaelazzo/edge-sql) or in [myKodeBackend](https://github.com/TempoSrl/myKode_Backend)
